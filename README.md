## Abstract
Wikipedia (Main Page, n.d.) has grown to become a go-to source for all kinds of information available in multiple languages. It is often and erroneously seen as an unbiased source since it is created by its users as an open-source project and is _democratically_ edited. While a wealth of information can indeed be seen as unbiased, bias is frequently present when articles on controversial topics are published. Wikipedia allows any user to edit a given article by clicking on the "edit" button, which takes her/him to a new page where the text can be altered. Thus, articles on Wikipedia typically contain several revisions, back-and-forth, until a consensus is reached. When more contentious issues are featured, however, a consensus may never be reached, and the competing factions continue their battle for _their truth_ to become the established one.
This study analyzes Wikipedia articles related to the Catalonian Independence Process (El Procés), a movement to separate from Spain, ultimately bringing about a contested referendum on independence in 2017. It is shown that this controversy has resulted in hundreds of competing edits on the related pages. Using multidimensional sentiment analysis (Jockers, 2015), we can further observe how sentiments have changed over time and are affected by discrete historical events. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the contributions also show that the competing factions have deployed artificial intelligence in their quest for an upper hand in defense of their position.
A comparison of articles across languages –versions are available in Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, Basque, Galician and Esperanto– show that users of minority languages tend to be more sympathetic to the independence movement. This is perhaps not surprising given the history of Spain and the current context. We also see that, while the positions may converge/diverge over time, the _truth_ mof the matter is most often divergent, _La Verdad_ is not _La Veritat_.
